# Arch Setup
Install the following plugin dependencies:

## Base
The following dependencies are needed for multliple plugins:
```bash
pacman -S curl
pacman -S unzip

# python
pacman -S python python-pip

# node and npm, many LSP need this
pacman -S nodejs npm
```

### telescope.nvim
```bash
pacman -S ripgrep
```

## For Jupyter Notebooks
The following plugins are only needed if you want to render and execute code inside Jupyter notebooks. Note that you may run into several problems in making this work properly. If I'm being honest , I've been lazy to figure out how to make this work exactly. I recommend not trying this unless you absolutely want to use Neovim on notebooks.

To begin with, rename the following files:
```
mv quarto.lua.unstable quarto.lua
mv images.lua.unstable images.lua
mv render.lua.unstable render.lua
mv repl.lua.unstable repl.lua
```

Now install the following dependendies:
### image.nvim
```bash
# for magick_cli
sudo apt install luarocks imagemagick libmagick++-dev
# for magick_rock
sudo apt install libmagickwand-dev
```

### molten.nvim
```bash
# create a virtual environment
cd ~/.envs # path matters
python -m venv neovim
source ~/.envs/neovim/bin/activate

# install the following deps
pip install pynvim jupyter_client cairosvg plotly kaleido pnglatex pyperclip nbformat jupytext jupyter jupyterlab
```
if you want to use a different path than `~/.envs/neovim/`, then you must edit `lua/core/options.lua` and change this line:
```lua
vim.g.python3_host_prog = vim.fn.expand '~/.envs/neovim/bin/python3'
```

you will also need quarto cli:
```bash
# get latest release
wget https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v1.6.40/quarto-1.6.40-linux-amd64.deb

# install
sudo dpkg -i quarto-1.6.40-linux-amd64.deb
```
