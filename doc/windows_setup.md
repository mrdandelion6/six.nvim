# Windows Setup
I am using `scoop`. You can use whatever package manager that works for you.

## Installing Scoop
```bash
# in powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh | iex

# verify
scoop help
```

Install the following plugin dependencies:

## Base
The following dependencies are needed for multliple plugins:
```bash
scoop install curl unzip

# python
scoop install python

# node and npm, many LSP need this
scoop install nodejs

# used by certain LSP like latex
npm install -g tree-sitter-cli
```

### telescope.nvim
```bash
scoop install ripgrep
```

## LaTeX

It is recommended to download MiKTeX from: https://miktex.org/ rather than `scoop` for better Windows integration, and it also comes with TeXworks, which is the PDF viewer we use.

**Installation:**
1. Go to https://miktex.org/download
2. Download the **Net Installer** (not Basic Installer)
3. Run as Administrator and choose **"Install MiKTeX for all users"**
4. When prompted for installation scope, select **"Complete MiKTeX"** to install all packages at once (~4GB)
   - Alternative: Choose "Basic MiKTeX" if you prefer to install packages as needed

**After installation:**
1. Open **MiKTeX Console** and go to **Updates** tab
2. Click **"Check for updates"** and install all available updates
3. Verify installation by running in Command Prompt:
   ```cmd
   latex --version
   pdflatex --version
   latexmk --version
   texworks --version

## For Jupyter Notebooks
Have not attempted any Windows support for this. You can try to mimic the dependencies in [ubuntu_setup.md](ubuntu_setup.md).
